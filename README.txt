=========================== README =========================

Hello, this project deals with the user registration and profile management. 

I've used the user-registration package which uses django authentication. Please install the registration module first.

I've added the USER-REGISTRATION(django)folder with this. Paste it to any directory and then run setup.py.

Now all you need to do is create a database as desired and then run syncdb command. Create a super user. 

NOTE: I've used super user to create other users, since i wasn't having MAIL SERVER. So just of checking the functionality I created user using admin login.

The project is named GalleryWebsite though it lack gallery functionality. I'll update it soon.

Thanks for downloading.
